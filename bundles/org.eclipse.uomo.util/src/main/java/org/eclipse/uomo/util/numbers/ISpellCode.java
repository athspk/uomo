/**
 * In this project, we have used a unique way of encoding spelled number to a
 * string. Each known word (or punctuation) in a spelled number string is
 * converted to a case-sensitive single-character code. For example, the spelled
 * number:
 * 
 * Two Thousand, Three Hundred and Nine (2,309)
 * 
 * is encoded as:
 * 
 * 2T,3I&9
 * 
 * In this encoding,
 * 
 * 2 represents the word: "two", T represents the word: :thousand", Comma (,)
 * represents itself, 3 represents the word: "three", I represents the word:
 * "hundred", ampersand (&) represents the word: "and", and finally, 9
 * represents the word nine.
 * 
 * The great advantage of this encoding is that it would be fairly easy to
 * validate a text as being a correct spelled number using regular expression.
 * 
 * SpellCode class is a way to hold encoding and recognition information for a
 * single known word in spelling contexts. These are words like thousand,
 * fourteen etc which all have a name (e.g., fourteen), a dedicated
 * case-sensitive single-character code (U) and an associative value (14).
